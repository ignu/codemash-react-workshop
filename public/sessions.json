How are thoughts shared? One way is by using words.  But, which words should you use?  And how can you tell if your words effectively convey your thoughts?  What causes miscommunication, what are its effects, and how can you avoid it?  And what are the benefits and limitations of a shared language?\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will move from general to specific as we collaboratively attempt to understand and answer these questions, and many more.  Starting with the definition of definition, we will investigate words and meaning, their properties, and their relationship.  We will then examine how miscommunication can occur, look at some potential consequences of it, and explore some methods to minimize it.  Finally, we will apply these ideas as we attempt to define some common terms and create a “common language”. In the end, attendees will gain new knowledge and tools to help them more effectively transfer ideas with words.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Takeaways:\r\n\r\n* Deeper understanding of the meaning of words and meaning.\r\n* Some causes and effects of miscommunication and practical techniques to avoid it.\r\n* The difficulty of creating a shared language, even in a microcosm.\r\n* Ways to better understand others, and be better understood.","SessionType":"Pre-Compiler","Tags":["Soft Skills / Business"],"Category":"Project Leadership/Soft Skills","Speakers":[{"Id":"0de90b5d-4192-4952-9f3c-c0d20bdc54ce","FirstName":"damian","LastName":"synadinos","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7e3b73442aea846855f81760e982fb7"}]},{"Id":5901,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-10T08:00:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-10T12:00:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Cypress"],"Title":"Game Development with the Unity Game Engine","Abstract":"You want to make video games with the Unity game engine?

Successful improv involves learning and using a variety of skills and techniques which allow performers to quickly adapt to a constantly changing environment and new information. Now reread the previous sentence, but replace the word improv with testing. In many ways, improv is a great analogy for testing. As both an experienced improviser and tester, Damian Synadinos presents some of the many similarities between improv and testing.  After setting expectations, Damian takes a closer look at the definitions of improv and testing to better understand their purpose and value.  He then thoroughly explains and demonstrates numerous improv tips and tricks with help from the audience, and shows how the very same ideas can be useful in a testing context. Using creative metaphors and critical analysis, old ideas about testing are reframed in novel and notable ways.

If you believe you’re not an artist, that UI is merely subjective, or that great design takes too much effort, then this workshop is for you. Learn the essence with simple, easy-to-retain guidelines. Regardless of whether you’re building interfaces for watches, mobile, tablets, web, desktops, elevators, trains, planes, automobiles, HoloLens, or interplanetary spaceships; you’ll learn how to reduce visual noise, enhance clarity, widen the path, and design interfaces that are a pleasure to use. \r\n\r\nLearn what's really happening inside the brain and how human biology drives important design guidelines. Get a grip on cognitive load, saccades & fixations, peripheral blindness, grouping, granularity, channel limitations, cellular data compression, and symbol recognition. Conduct mind experiments, live in the session, to derive crucial design guidelines for creating better user interfaces. \r\n\r\nThese guidelines will help you present any information -- any data in any medium -- with clarity. We'll learn how to work with foreground, background, color, size, shape, and emphasis to reduce noise, boost signal, and achieve clarity in your software designs. This workshop is loaded with real-life examples from both the virtual and physical worlds, and includes groundbreaking research and exclusive content. \r\n\r\nWe'll also explore dark design patterns and the business case behind great usability. We'll learn how to measure the cost of bad UI, and how to present compelling cases for great design to decision makers. Ultimately it’s all about making customers satisfied, and this entertaining and information-packed workshop will show you how.","SessionType":"Pre-Compiler","Tags":["Design (UI/UX/CSS)"],"Category":"Design (UI/UX)","Speakers":[{"Id":"9d113a83-30ff-41df-b093-7b44f852b7ce","FirstName":"Mark","LastName":"Miller","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/16cc1eea9cb56905335600fc60f6c052"}]},{"Id":6303,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-10T13:00:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-10T17:00:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Orange"],"Title":"Unleash the computer on your data","Abstract":"Wondering why your magic 8 ball keeps telling you the same things when you ask it about your data?

One of the hardest parts about learning a new technical skill or concept can be finding ways to apply those skills in our daily practice, especially when constrained by time or money to achieve a specific goal. Sometimes, one of the best ways to learn is to break away from what we're used to and learn in a totally new environment, the better to bring those new experiences and ideas back to the environments we’re used to once we return.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we’ll start by exploring two functional programming languages that these days are relegated largely to academic study, highlighting the influences they’ve had on modern functional programming paradigms and reinforcing these ideas with exercises to be solved as a group along the way. First, we’ll cover ML, a language whose ideology remains largely unchanged for over 40 years and considered the common ancestor of modern functional languages like Haskell, OCaml and F#. Next, we’ll cover Racket, a LISP derived from Scheme which shares similarities and probably inspiration with a number of currently popular languages, perhaps most obviously, Clojure and perhaps less obviously, Javascript. Lastly, we’re back to where you work: I’ll present exercises that help to reinforce the ideas learned from ML and Racket to be solved either in the language of your choosing, or Javascript (the de facto language of examples and solutions du jour).\r\n\r\nJoin me for an enlightening foray into some languages largely forgotten or ignored by the industry that are certain to help you bring new ideas about functional programming to your daily practice, whatever it may be.\r\n","SessionType":"Pre-Compiler","Tags":["Functional Programming"],"Category":"Programming Principles","Speakers":[{"Id":"dee57fae-0230-40ff-8a11-363bd8c2ff93","FirstName":"Nathan","LastName":"Dotz","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3f6a4543c701c805aca9e2ffc7c6333"}]},{"Id":6244,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-11T13:00:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-11T17:00:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Salon D"],"Title":"Git Hands-On Workshop","Abstract":"Building on the core Git concepts covered in Part 1, this session will provide a detailed exploration of the advanced configuration and commands that will earn you a spot in your friends' and coworkers' [git.txt](https://xkcd.com/1597/).

First there was static memory layout, then manual memory management and eventually smart pointers.  Today most developers work in a garbage collected language. This largely mitigates issues of memory management, but provides no help with other resources. In 2015, the Rust language baked in a new approach that unifies memory and resource management. Could this approach be the future of memory management? Come learn about each approach and their trade-offs through code examples.  Seeing Rust's borrow checker will change how you think about resource management in other languages.  Then, take a peek at some languages that may bring this new approach to a broader audience.","SessionType":"General Session","Tags":["Other"],"Category":"Programming Principles","Speakers":[{"Id":"5857a32c-db60-4d08-b287-7a7fa1e22a79","FirstName":"Jeff","LastName":"Walker","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/b37c3e5638c2886054fdc62a5521be33"}]},{"Id":6037,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-12T11:45:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-12T12:45:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Salon E"],"Title":"Unconventional Automation – Using test artifacts to reveal new testing capabilities","Abstract":"Test automation artifacts have the potential to create unique testing opportunities against their systems under test.

In this talk, we discuss harnessing existing AWS functionality to strengthen your organization's AWS infrastructure against practical attacks. Ken will show you what attackers are looking for, how they are finding you, and how to secure your environment.

Once a build is triggered, the CTF system automatically builds and deploys the new version of the application. A score bot is permanently testing whether the applications are still vulnerable.\r\n\r\nBesides the attack/defense part, there are other tasks as well.

Semantic UI is a framework that aims to create rich UIs “using human-friendly HTML.”  Gone are the days of col-md-3.  Instead, our HTML will have classes like “three column wide”. But it’s more than that. Semantic UI has a wide variety of elements, collections, and views that can make any application pop, all while following sane patterns.\r\n\r\nThis talk will examine several key UI components, and talk about the underlying principles of Semantic UI.

It can be intimidating if you're accustomed to other kinds of source control management.  Even if you're already using it and comfortable with the basics, situations can arise where you wish you understood it better.  Developers often just want to write code and tell everyone else to take a hike, but the reality is that most of us work on teams where the feature-based code we write must be integrated, tested, and ultimately released.  This session will cover the most critical git concepts, basic and advanced, in a completely visualized way.  At the same time, you’ll pick up git terminal commands to help you understand (or even eliminate) a git GUI you already use.

Lambdas provide some great benefits to making implementation of listeners and interfaces easier.  They provide a much more compact way to represent Anonymous inline overrides, but they also run into the same problems when writing unit tests.  As RXJava is being used more and more to make asynchronous code easier for Android, it is making it more difficult to unit test as well due.  Forcing more integration testing and less unit testing.  Causing in many causes for tests to no be written.\r\n\r\nWe will look at some refactoring techniques that can be used, look at some situations where using a lambda may not be the best way to accomplish things.   We'll take a look at tools like Butterknife that can accomplish similar things but in a more straight forward way to allow unit testing to occur.  In addition we'll look at some ways to test those RXJava Lambda expressions.   These patterns come from experience on a large retail project that has over 1000 tests and heavily leverages RXJava, Retrofit, Butterknife, Dagger, and many other square related frameworks.\r\n\r\nBy the end, the attendees will have some tools they can take back, and apply to their own projects to help make unit testing easier when dealing with Lambda expressions.\r\n","SessionType":"General Session","Tags":["Mobile","Testing","Java"],"Category":"Mobile","Speakers":[{"Id":"5f4b8ecf-f24f-4f7a-8822-38f8b8c1c05b","FirstName":"David","LastName":"Carver","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdec28d17fb2417999492a96fb338eae"}]},{"Id":5517,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-13T09:45:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-13T10:45:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Salon H"],"Title":"Using the GPU to Write an Elegant AI Algorithm using CUDA","Abstract":"During this talk we will create a simple AI algorithm using CUDA on an NVIDA GPU.

Whether you want to be a penetration tester, move into application security, or just understand how this all works, the first essential step is thinking like an attacker. This is an often repeated idea in the secuirty industry: to excel at defending, you must understand the attacks, and vice versa. Switching into an offensive mindset takes effort and practice.\r\n\r\nThis switch requires breaking old habits and ideas. Instead of testing if an application will accept the intended input, you need to learn to twist your usual thinking and look for ways errors and different functions can be abused. This can be difficult to do when you are accustomed to only thinking about what your intended user will do with the application. This presentation will discuss basic concepts used by security researchers (e.g. fuzzing) and how penetration testers, and less friendly attackers, will attempt to break an application for their own designs.

It's a task that requires savvy offensive maneuvers in order to position yourself well for desired opportunities, to quickly seize new opportunities when they present themselves, and to maximize your potential career earnings. It also requires shrewd defensive tactics to ensure that you're prepared to bounce back quickly should you unexpectedly experience Career Armageddon due to the upheaval associated with mergers, acquisitions, downsizing, offshoring, slumping economies, sagging sales, technical obsolescence, or changes in management and business strategies.\r\n\r\nTo successfully manage one's career in today's chaotic marketplace, it is paramount that each of us consistently has an eye towards our desired career path and a plan towards getting there. At the same time, it's also important to ensure that our personal \"Job Search Toolkit\" is always at its peak in order to quickly seize new opportunities and rapidly recover from unexpected career setbacks.\r\n\r\nIn this session, representatives from Stout Systems will discuss a number of career management topics, including:\r\n\r\na) Preparing a technical resume that adeptly conveys your story, resonates with today's hiring managers, and sets you apart from the crowd, \r\n\r\nb) Creating and maintaining a strong online presence that attracts new opportunities, lets you move rapidly into active job search mode whenever necessary, and genuinely helps (not hinders) your search activities, and\r\n\r\nc) Creating and maintaining your network of professional relationships effortlessly so that you can lean on it if and when it ever becomes a necessity.\r\n\r\nAll attendees will be eligible for Stout's Ruthless Resume Review™ service—in which Stout's highly skilled resume review team provides written advice concerning any improvements that can be made to help attendees achieve their career goals.","SessionType":"Sponsor Session","Tags":[],"Category":"Architecture","Speakers":[{"Id":"db613f97-ced1-4331-a040-16d8db5bc9b7","FirstName":null,"LastName":"Stout Systems","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/b56c2d09a5295b8d5167587df06a749a"}]},{"Id":6648,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-13T13:30:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-13T14:15:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Cypress"],"Title":"So You Know How To Code?

A solution to this is B.E.M., or Block Element Modifier. B.E.M. is a CSS architecture. It's a methodology. It's a naming convention. It is based off of Object Oriented CSS. This talk will focus on basic B.E.M. CSS architecture and how it can be the solution towards modularity and writing clean, well maintained code within a large organization.\r\n\r\nCSS is hard, we all know that. There has to be a more effective way to facilitate the modularity and flexibility of our code. When tasked with creating new components for a Web project and inheriting over 8,000 lines of code, where do you start? When you are told to keep it modular as possible, what solutions do you have at your disposal? During this time is when you break in to your bag-of-tricks with one of the many modular CSS architectures out there.\r\n\r\nB.E.M. is a great method to use to keep code very flexible and modular from component to component, and page to page. The greatest thing about using B.E.M. is the reusability of the code and being able to maintain the code in small pieces opposed to a large blocks with excessive declarations and generic naming.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest takeaways from using B.E.M. is the naming of styles. With B.E.M., you can be as specific as you want to describe exactly what that style is being applied too. Naming the style according to where it is being applied and what it is being used for helps other developers who inherit your code as well as your future self.","SessionType":"General Session","Tags":["Other"],"Category":"Web/Front-End","Speakers":[{"Id":"fb3f8676-2a32-4bfa-9aba-9df2ae79ca26","FirstName":"Chris","LastName":"DeMars","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3f94842fc85e55a97eabea7f06059f7"}]},{"Id":5658,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-13T14:45:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-13T15:45:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Salon E"],"Title":"Functional Web Programming using Elm","Abstract":"How can you bring true functional programming into the web world AND transpile down to JavaScript so you can run it anywhere?

Can We Unteach Them?","Abstract":"Machine learning techniques are based on the assumption that the future will resemble the past, with some allowance for uncertainty and yet-unobserved events. That assumption has held up well in machine learning applications like advertising, weather, and self driving cars. But what about applications that predict a person’s future actions and use that prediction to make a big decision about that person's life?  What if we train our machine learning systems on data containing human biases we do not want to reinforce in the future? This talk first draws on the use of machine learning classification techniques in criminal sentencing to explore questions about how machine learning systems learn human biases. It will then look to promising work at MIT that demonstrates removing unwanted biases from Google’s word2vec, a vector space representing word meanings. Many machine learning techniques, including the classification used in the sentencing case, start with building a vector space to mathematically represent our observations of the past. If we can, as MIT researchers have, ‘de-bias’ our vector spaces, perhaps we can use machine learning to create the future we want.","SessionType":"General Session","Tags":["Cloud/Big Data"],"Category":"Data (big/small/otherwise)","Speakers":[{"Id":"6e94f1ec-1963-4e59-89cc-b555d4060ce2","FirstName":"Devney","LastName":"Hamilton","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f9e9a35c62a2879ff55c57dddb954b1"}]},{"Id":6218,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2017-01-13T14:45:00","SessionEndTime":"2017-01-13T15:45:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Cypress"],"Title":"Native iOS and Android Development with C# and Xamarin","Abstract":"Xamarin helps C# developers become native iOS, Android, and Windows mobile app developers overnight.

The short answer is yes - if you are willing to change the way you collaborate, code, and test your application. Allowing defects in your software is an admission that it is okay to have a low quality product. This creates the mindset that believes quality is not important which is propagated throughout the code that is produced. Teams that have zero defects can deliver at a consistent pace and often more rapidly over the long term than teams that log their defects.\r\n\r\nDefects cost much more than is obvious. Between documenting, inventorying, prioritizing, reproducing, fixing, retesting and all the meetings and pizzas to get to releasable software, it is a huge amount of waste that many organizations believe is unavoidable. And then there comes the “hardening phase”!\r\n\r\nJoin Cheezy as he brings more than a dozen years of hands-on experience coaching teams on agile engineering and team practices that drive quality higher.

Zooming in to look at details of a picture, reversing it, changing its color, contrast, etc. are all functions we take for granted.   *Why isnt such functionality commonplace for audio as well?* \r\n\r\nSure, we can sample, loop, process, and transform audio samples, but *we can't zoom in to an instance of sound the same way *we can with an image because audio data is fundamentally different than video data.  \r\n\r\n*The reason is that audio data is movement.*\r\n\r\nIt captures the movement of the surface of a microphone, which can later move the surface of a speaker, creating sound waves which move the surface of our ears.
